# Etch A Sketch

## Description

I built this project as part of the Foundations course with The Odin Project. As my second larger project in JavaScript, this project is my response to the prompt wherein students are challenged to use learned and new concepts in Javascript to create a grid-based sketch pad in the browser console.

This project got me much better acquainted with DOM Manipulation and UI concepts that I had previously learned and implemented in (Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock)[https://github.com/kranor2/rock-paper-scissors], such as event listeners, query selectors, and function expressions. I was also able to further my exploration of CSS skills, including hover state, a new cursor property (crosshair), and a brief glimpse into grid display (as opposed to flex). I also got to gain more valuable experience in debugging, especially using the browser console.

On top of that, I was able to implement newly learned skills that I gathered through my own research, independent of what I have learned so far from The Odin Project's resources. This includes styling in Javascript, for/of loops and definitions, different forms of inputs and their usage in HTML / manipulation in Javascript, and more use cases / benefits of creating DOM elements (especially creating many of the same element at once) in Javascript.

I will return in the future to style the page and create a more appealing front end.
